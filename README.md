# dbt-airflow-snowflake-pipeline-hands-on-project
A hands-on project showcasing how to build and orchestrate modern data pipelines using dbt with Snowflake as the data warehouse and Apache Airflow for workflow scheduling. The project runs inside VS Code, demonstrating end-to-end data engineering practices:

* dbt + Snowflake for modular, SQL-based data transformations

* Airflow DAGs to orchestrate dbt runs and tests on Snowflake

* Local development setup with Python virtual environment (or Docker)

* Ready-to-extend framework for real-world data engineering projects
